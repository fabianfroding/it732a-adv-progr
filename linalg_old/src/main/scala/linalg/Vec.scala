  // ------- Element-wise operations -------

  /**
  * The following operations are element-wise. That is, each opeartion will
  * result in a new vector (or matrix) of the same shape, but with each element equal to
  * the corresponding operation.
  * There are three groups: operations with Doubles, with Vectors, and with Matrices.
  * Examples:
  *   m = [[1, 1], [2, 2]]
  *   v = [2, 3]
  *
  *   With doubles:
  *   v + 5 == [7, 8]
  *   m - 5 == [-3, -2]
  *
  *   With Vectors:
  *   v * v == [4, 6]
  *
  *   With Matrices:
  *   v / m == [[2, 3], [1, 1.5]]
  *
  * Notes:
  * - For Vector operations you may assume that the sizes are equal.
  * - For Matrix operations you may assume that the size of this vector is equal
  *   to the number of columns in the matrix.
  * - Take into account that subtraction and division are non-associative! (v - m != m - v).
